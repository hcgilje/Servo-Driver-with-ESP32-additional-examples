# Updated arduino examples for the SCservo library

I have modified and added a few more examples to expose more of the features of the SCservo library.
You can find them in the STSCL folder.

It has been tested on a waveshare ST3020 servo, a smart serial bus servo, but should also work with many of the Feetec serial bus servos as they share the same registry.

I looked at some of the examples from the STS_servos library and implemented some of the examples found there:

There are some useful documents from Feetech in the STS_servos repo:
